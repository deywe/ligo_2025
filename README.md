# Gravitational Data Correction – HARPIA+SPHY (Public Module)

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository provides an open-source example of how to apply gravitational correction to raw strain data obtained from LIGO or similar gravitational wave measurements.

This example demonstrates the influence of multiple celestial bodies (Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter) using Newtonian gravitational physics. A simplified dual-sinusoidal signal is used to generate illustrative results in 2D.

## ⚠️ Full 3D Gravitational Reconstruction Pipeline

While this public script presents the gravitational correction method and visual output (2D waveform adjustment), the full **3D reconstruction** pipeline — including Fourier spectral interpolation, predictive quantum-state modeling (SPHY), and hidden-layer mesh estimation — is part of the proprietary HARPIA+SPHY engine.

This complete 3D process is not available in this repository for intellectual property reasons.

However:

> ✅ To test your own dataset with the full inference model in 3D, please access our official validation platform:

### 🔗 [https://www.harpiaco2.com.br](https://www.harpiaco2.com.br)

You can upload your CSV-formatted gravitational signal (real or simulated), and validate it live using the framework developed by the authors.

The platform was created from research contributions by [Deywe Anderson](https://github.com/deywe) and [Dr. Inês Brosso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inesbrosso/), and includes the full predictive 3D quantum-behavior model.

## 📌 Disclaimer

> **NOTE:**  
> This example uses simulated data and a simplified correction model for illustrative purposes only.  
> The full scientific engine (HARPIA+SPHY) that reconstructs the quantum-enhanced waveform in 3D remains closed-source under current research licensing.

If you are a researcher, and would like access to additional resources or review the full architecture via proposal or partnership, please contact the author(s) directly via the platform.
