# Gravitational Data Correction – HARPIA+SPHY (Public Module)

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository provides an open-source example of how to apply gravitational correction to raw strain data obtained from LIGO or similar gravitational wave measurements.

This example demonstrates the influence of multiple celestial bodies (Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter) using Newtonian gravitational physics. A simplified dual-sinusoidal signal is used to generate illustrative results in 2D.

## ⚠️ Full 3D Gravitational Reconstruction Pipeline

While this public script presents the gravitational correction method and visual output (2D waveform adjustment), the full **3D reconstruction** pipeline — including Fourier spectral interpolation, predictive quantum-state modeling (SPHY), and hidden-layer mesh estimation — is part of the proprietary HARPIA+SPHY engine.

This complete 3D process is not available in this repository for intellectual property reasons.

However:

> ✅ To test your own dataset with the full inference model in 3D, please access our official validation platform:

### 🔗 [https://www.harpiaco2.com.br](https://www.harpiaco2.com.br)

You can upload your CSV-formatted gravitational signal (real or simulated), and validate it live using the framework developed by the authors.

The platform was created from research contributions by [Deywe Okabe](https://github.com/deywe) and [Dr. Inês Brosso]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/inesbrosso/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ines-brosso-16331b/)), and includes the full predictive 3D quantum-behavior model.

## 📌 Disclaimer

> **NOTE:**  
> This example uses simulated data and a simplified correction model for illustrative purposes only.  
> The full scientific engine (HARPIA+SPHY) that reconstructs the quantum-enhanced waveform in 3D remains closed-source under current research licensing.

If you are a researcher, and would like access to additional resources or review the full architecture via proposal or partnership, please contact the author(s) directly via the platform.

🛠️ Workflow: Validating LIGO Data Using HARPIA + SPHY
This repository allows researchers to experiment with real or simulated gravitational wave data — such as LIGO strain datasets — and apply symbolic gravitational correction and structural validation through SPHY-based modeling.

Follow the step-by-step validation process below:

📥 Step 1: Download LIGO Dataset

Visit a public LIGO repository or other source providing raw strain data.

Choose any raw dataset of your interest.

Rename the downloaded file to:

dados_lido.txt

This is required for compatibility with the conversion script.

🔁 Step 2: Convert the Dataset into SPHY-Compatible Format
Use the provided converter script to transform LIGO’s raw .txt data into a .csv file readable by the SPHY modules. Run the following:

▶️ File:

➡️ https://github.com/deywe/ligo_2025/blob/main/conver_txt_LIGO_dataset_to_csv_file.py

This will generate a structured CSV file with columns like amplitude_ligo, tempo, sphy_sem_prev, and sphy_com_prev.

📊 Step 3: Analyze and Visualize in 2D Mode
You can now process your pre-processed CSV file using gravitational correction, FFT, and waveform mesh visualization:

Use any of the following open-source modules available in this repository:


🌀 FFT-Based Structural Analysis:

These scripts reconstruct vibrational patterns with residual coherence signals influenced by multi-body gravitational forces (Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter).

🧠 Step 4: Full 3D Quantum Integration (HARPIA AI)
To perform higher-dimensional quantum circuit testing, with real-time feedback and predictive coherence modeling, you'll need to access the proprietary HARPIA interface.

🔗 Access the HARPIA AI platform at:

🛸 What you can do:


Upload your converted CSV-formatted dataset

Execute the STDJ (System of Temporal Just-Fold) modulation pipeline

View dynamic 3D quantum resonance reconstructions

Validate structure against Qiskit circuits and SPHY-layer predictions

The platform implements the full inference engine using symbolic resonance terms ( S(\Phi) = \frac{\lambda G}{1 + \gamma \Phi^2} ) and phase-interpolated mesh alignment.

⚠️ Note: Full 3D capabilities are only available through the hosted web platform due to computational complexity and licensing terms.

🌀 Summary:

🧬 About HARPIA+SPHY
This research was initiated by Deywe Okabe and Dr. Inês Brosso in the context of quantum-gravitational alignment and meta-material symbiosis. It applies symbolic fields and gravitational harmonics for coherence maintenance in quantum-phase systems.

Algorithm core: STDJ — Self-Stabilizing Temporal Dobration

Model base: ( H = H_0 + S(\Phi) )

Thank you for your contribution to quantum-gravitational validation.

We support transparent science and open reproducibility — harmonized with respect for active innovation.

🎼 Classical vs SPHY Resonance: A Side-by-Side Comparison
To understand the conceptual leap introduced by SPHY, we encourage researchers to compare two fundamental approaches:

📦 Script #1

→ FFT_LIGO_SPHY_eng.py  

🔍 Traditional Fourier decomposition of a multi-tone gravitational signal.

🥣 Script #2

→ canja_gravitacional.py  

🧠 Applies gravitational correction using real planetary field values (Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter) to the raw amplitude before waveform analysis.


"In one, you observe frequency.

In the other, you remove distortion to hear the signal behind the cosmos." 🌌
